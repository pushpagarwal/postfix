This is the Postfix 3.7 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.6.x where 3=major
release number, 6=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.7-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.5 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.6
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20210605
====================================

Support to inline the content of small cidr, pcre, and regexp tables.

Example:

    smtpd_forbidden_commands =
	CONNECT GET POST regexp:{{/^[^A-Z]/ Thrash}}

The basic syntax is:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    parameter = .. map-type:{ { rule-1 }, { rule-2 } .. } ..

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    .. -o { parameter = .. map-type:{ { rule-1 }, { rule-2 } .. } .. } ..

Postfix ignores whitespace after '{' and before '}', and writes each
rule as one text line to an in-memory file: 

in-memory file:
    rule-1
    rule-2
    ..

Postfix parses the result as if it is a file in /etc/postfix.

Note: if a rule contains $, specify $$, to keep Postfix from trying to
do $name expansion as it evaluates the parameter value.
